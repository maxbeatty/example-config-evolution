Example of a web app configuration evolving

## [v1](https://github.com/maxbeatty/example-config-evolution/tree/v1)

It all starts with a simple web app that accepts requests and responds. It stands alone with no external dependencies or services. The only thing you might want to change is the port the server listens on.

## [v2](https://github.com/maxbeatty/example-config-evolution/tree/v2)

Now you want a persistent store such as a database so you add [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/). You installed and started PostgreSQL locally and everything works fine. No configuration needed!
